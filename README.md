# Object-Detection
Webcam Object Detection uses the models provided by Tensorflow (Open Library) to detect the objects in supermarket. These models are trained on the COCO dataset. By extending this API, several other objects in supermarket are being trained. The main aim of this project, is to help the visually impaired identify the products in supermarket.
