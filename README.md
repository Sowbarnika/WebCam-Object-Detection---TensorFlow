# Object-Detection Team 11
Webcam Object Detection uses tensorflow APIs to detect the objects in supermarket. These models are trained on the COCO dataset. By extending this API, several other objects in supermarket are being trained. This project overcomes the drawbacks of QR Code Scanning System.
